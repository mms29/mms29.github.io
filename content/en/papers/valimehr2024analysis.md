## Abstract
Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been shown to be effective in defining the structure of macromolecules, including protein complexes. Complexes adopt different conformations and compositions to perform their biological functions. In cryo-EM, the protein complexes are observed in solution, enabling the recording of images of the protein in multiple conformations. Various methods exist for capturing the conformational variability through analysis of cryo-EM data. Here, we analyzed the conformational variability in the hexameric AAA + ATPase p97, a complex with a six-fold rotational symmetric core surrounded by six flexible N-domains. We compared the performance of discrete classification methods with our recently developed method, MDSPACE, which uses 3D-to-2D flexible fitting of an atomic structure to images based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our analysis detected a novel conformation adopted by approximately 2% of the particles in the dataset and determined that the N-domains of p97 sway by up to 60° around a central position. This study demonstrates the application of MDSPACE in analyzing the continuous conformational changes in partially symmetrical protein complexes, systems notoriously difficult to analyze due to the alignment errors caused by their partial symmetry.
