## Abstract
ContinuousFlex is a user-friendly open-source software package for analyzing continuous conformational variability of macromolecules in cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) data. In 2019, ContinuousFlex became available as a plugin for Scipion, an image processing software package extensively used in the cryo-EM field. Currently, ContinuousFlex contains software for running (1) recently published methods HEMNMA-3D, TomoFlow, and NMMD; (2) earlier published methods HEMNMA and StructMap; and (3) methods for simulating cryo-EM and cryo-ET data with conformational variability and methods for data preprocessing. It also includes external software for molecular dynamics simulation (GENESIS) and normal mode analysis (ElNemo), used in some of the mentioned methods. The HEMNMA software has been presented in the past, but not the software of other methods. Besides, ContinuousFlex currently also offers a deep learning extension of HEMNMA, named DeepHEMNMA. In this article, we review these methods in the context of the ContinuousFlex package, developed to facilitate their use by the community.
